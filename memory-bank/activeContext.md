# Active Context

## Current Task Status: COMPLETED ✅
Added support for string operations: "starts with", "ends with", and "contains".

## Problem Solved
JSONLogic by default doesn't have support for "ends with", "starts with", and "contains" operations. We implemented these using JSONLogic's existing operators:
- **starts with**: Uses `substr` with start position 0 and length matching substring length
- **ends with**: Uses `substr` with negative start position matching substring length
- **contains**: Uses the existing `in` operator (substring in string)

## Key Changes Made
1. **Updated Grammar (REL.g4)**:
   - Added `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `CONTAINS` tokens
   - Added corresponding expression rules in relational expressions

2. **Enhanced JSONLogic Visitor**:
   - Added `visitStartsWithExpression`: Generates `{"==": [{"substr": [string, 0, length]}, substring]}`
   - Added `visitEndsWithExpression`: Generates `{"==": [{"substr": [string, -length]}, substring]}`
   - Added `visitContainsExpression`: Generates `{"in": [substring, string]}`

3. **Enhanced JSONLogic to REL Converter**:
   - Added `detectStringOperation`: Detects starts/ends with patterns in `==` expressions
   - Enhanced `detectContainsPattern`: Detects contains patterns in `in` expressions
   - Updated conversion logic to handle string operation patterns

4. **Added Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Forward conversion tests (REL → JSONLogic)
   - Reverse conversion tests (JSONLogic → REL)
   - All tests pass with bidirectional conversion ✅

## Implementation Details
- **starts with**: `@x starts with "abc"` → `{"==": [{"substr": [{"var": "x"}, 0, 3]}, "abc"]}`
- **ends with**: `@customerEmail ends with "nike.com"` → `{"==": [{"substr": [{"var": "customerEmail"}, -8]}, "nike.com"]}`
- **contains**: `@customerPermissions contains "read:posts"` → `{"in": [{"var": "customerPermissions"}, "read:posts"]}`

## Verification
- All 222 tests pass ✅
- Bidirectional conversion works perfectly
- String operations integrate seamlessly with existing grammar
- Examples tested:
  - `@customerEmail ends with "nike.com"` ✅
  - `@x starts with "abc"` ✅
  - `@customerPermissions contains "read:posts"` ✅

## Next Steps
- String operations are fully implemented and tested
- Ready for production use
- Consider adding more string operations if needed (e.g., regex support)
