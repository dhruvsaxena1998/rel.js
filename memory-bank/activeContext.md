# Active Context

## Current Task Status: COMPLETED ✅
Fixed the JSONLogic to REL conversion for array method lambda expressions.

## Problem Solved
The test was failing because lambda expressions in array methods were not being converted correctly:
- **Issue**: `filter(@products, @price < 100)` was being generated instead of `filter(@products, product.price < 100)`
- **Root Cause**: Lambda expressions weren't handling variable context properly in array methods
- **Solution**: Enhanced `convertArrayMethod` and `convertLambdaExpression` functions to handle lambda context correctly

## Key Changes Made
1. **Enhanced `convertArrayMethod`**: Now extracts array variable name and converts plural to singular for lambda context
2. **Rewrote `convertLambdaExpression`**: Added proper lambda context handling with item name parameter
3. **Added `convertLambdaExpression_internal`**: Recursive helper for lambda expression conversion
4. **Added `convertBinaryOperatorLambda`**: Binary operator handling in lambda context

## Lambda Context Logic
- `products` → `product` (singular form for lambda variable)
- `users` → `user` 
- `permissions` → `permission`
- `{ "var": "price" }` in lambda → `product.price`
- `{ "var": "" }` in lambda → `item` (current iteration item)

## Verification
- All 26 tests now pass ✅
- Cross-validated with `translate()` function - all conversions translate back successfully
- Specific test cases verified:
  - `filter(@products, product.price < 100)` ✅
  - `map(@users, user.name)` ✅  
  - `some(@permissions, item == "admin")` ✅

## Next Steps
- Project is ready for use
- Consider adding more complex lambda expression test cases
- Documentation could be enhanced with lambda expression examples
